# Module 4

- I bit off a little more than I could chew with this one.
- I feel I was more than capable of finishing but just didnt leave myself enough time
- Most things are in a close to working state.
- the create is not working i believe it has to do with a type issue I got a validation error. I just did not have the time to fix it. The create was the last thing I started.
- the update needs fixed to better handle the difference from villains and heroes.
- I am sorry for the late upload I hope I can still get a grade as I tried to at least get a zip of the video and code but I had to resign in before I could submit.
